== High-Level Summary
The Boundary framework has completed the **Library Split Project**, successfully reorganizing the monolithic codebase into 10 independently publishable libraries. The framework maintains all competitive features (background jobs, distributed caching, file storage, API versioning/pagination, MFA, and full-text search), enterprise-grade security, and strict Functional Core / Imperative Shell architectural boundaries throughout.

**Current Production Readiness Rating: 9.7/10** (up from 6.6/10 → 8.5/10 → 9.0/10 → 9.5/10 → 9.7/10)

== Library Split Project: COMPLETE

  ** `boundary scaffolder endpoint` - Add single endpoint to module (generates http.clj instructions)
  ** `boundary scaffolder adapter` - Generate new adapter implementation file
  ** Full CLI integration with help text, validation, and dry-run support
  ** 8 tests, 64 assertions, all passing
* **Additional Examples**
  ** ✅ Blog application with HTMX web UI - COMPLETE (2026-01-17)
     *** Full FC/IS architecture demonstration
     *** SQLite persistence, Hiccup templating, Pico CSS
     *** ~1,500 lines production code + 17 unit tests
  ** ✅ E-commerce API with payment integration - COMPLETE (2026-01-17)
     *** 4 interconnected modules: product, cart, order, payment
     *** Order state machine (pending → paid → shipped → delivered)
     *** Mock Stripe payment provider with webhook handling
     *** ~2,500 lines production code + 35 unit tests (159 assertions)

* **MFA Login Flow Integration (2026-01-17):** MFA fully wired into authentication HTTP interceptors. Login flow now supports two-phase authentication with `mfaCode` parameter, returning `requiresMfa: true` response when MFA verification is needed. Supports both email/password and userId authentication methods.
* **Modular Admin Entity Configuration (2026-01-18):** Admin entity configurations moved from centralized `config.edn` to per-module files in `resources/conf/{env}/admin/{module}.edn`. Uses Aero's `#include` and `#merge` capabilities for clean module ownership. Future modules can add entity configs independently without modifying shared configuration.
* **Documentation Repository Split (2026-01-03):** Successfully split all documentation into separate `boundary-docs` repository while preserving complete git history (175 commits). Documentation now has independent CI/CD with automated Hugo deployment to GitHub Pages.
* **Documentation Reference Updates:** Updated 28 documentation files with current module references (user/inventory instead of billing/workflow) and corrected all cross-repository links.
* **Interceptors Everywhere:** Reitit adapter now wraps every route in the default HTTP interceptor stack, guaranteeing consistent correlation IDs, error handling, and observability hooks. Per-route interceptors still work and are appended after the defaults.
* **Reitit Tests:** Added coverage for default correlation headers, default error handling, and middleware ordering, ensuring the adapter changes remain regression-proof.
* **ADR Alignment:** ADR-010 now documents the "always-on" interceptor behavior and clarifies that `:system` is optional (defaults to `{}`) but recommended when real observability providers are bound.
* **Docs Cleanup:** Removed domain-specific billing/workflow references, kept documentation English-only, and aligned guides/architecture docs with the domain-agnostic approach.
* **Telemetry Pureness:** Type-conversion utilities refactored to stay pure (no logging side effects), reinforcing the FC/IS separation.

== In Progress / Upcoming

=== Immediate Priorities
* **Phase 3: Developer Experience** ✅ COMPLETE (100%)
  ** ✅ DONE: 5-Minute Quickstart Guide
  ** ✅ DONE: Documentation Hub & Navigation
  ** ✅ DONE: IDE Setup Guides (VSCode, IntelliJ, Emacs, Vim)
  ** ✅ DONE: Todo-API Example Application
  ** ✅ DONE: GitHub Pages deployment
  ** ✅ DONE: Scaffolding enhancements (field/endpoint/adapter commands)
  ** ✅ DONE: Blog application example with HTMX web UI
  ** ✅ DONE: E-commerce API with payment integration
  ** ✅ DONE: Notification service with event-driven architecture
* **Storage Module Refinements** - ✅ All tests passing (23 tests, 110 assertions)
* **Phase 5: Strategic Positioning** - Begin market positioning work
  ** Performance benchmarks against Django, Rails, Spring Boot
  ** Case studies and example applications
  ** Developer advocacy and content creation

=== Secondary Priorities
* **GitHub Pages Setup:** ✅ DONE - Documentation live at https://thijs-creemers.github.io/boundary-docs/
* **Global/Configurable Interceptors (Optional):** Evaluate whether router config should support additional global interceptors for shared policies (tenancy enforcement, etc.)
* **Repository-Wide Lint Debt:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Reduced from 478 to 228 warnings (52% reduction). Fixed unresolved namespaces, redundant lets, unused imports, and many unused bindings.

== Risks / Blockers

* **External Dependencies:** Several integration tests rely on local PostgreSQL; when unavailable they are skipped. Consider containerized fixtures or Testcontainers-like setup for reproducibility.
* **Lint Noise:** ✅ IMPROVED - Unresolved namespace errors fixed. Warnings reduced from 478 to 228 (52% reduction). Remaining 228 warnings are low-priority unused bindings.
* **Observability Providers:** Only no-op providers are guaranteed in dev/test. Wiring up real providers (Datadog, Sentry) needs environment-specific instructions before production rollout.
* **Storage Module Edge Cases:** ✅ RESOLVED - All 23 tests passing with 110 assertions

== Suggested Next Steps

1. **🎉 Phase 4 Complete!** All competitive features implemented and tested
2. **🎉 Phase 3 Complete!** Developer experience fully delivered
3. **Integration & Polish:**
   ** Integrate storage routes into main application router
   ** Configure default search indexes in migrations
   ** ✅ DONE: Wire MFA into authentication flows (HTTP layer integration - 2026-01-17)
4. **clj-kondo Cleanup Sprint:** ✅ 52% complete - 478 → 228 warnings. Continue with remaining unused bindings
5. **Test Infrastructure:** Evaluate Docker-based postgres fixture
6. **Phase 5 Preparation:**
   ** Performance benchmarking suite
   ** Example applications showcasing all features
   ** Developer advocacy materials
