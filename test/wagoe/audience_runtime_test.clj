  "Can an application actually enable audience?

   Until BOU-419 it could not. `:wagoe/audience`'s init-key throws without a
   `:user-data-source`, and `IUserDataSource` had no implementation anywhere —
   the only one in the repository was a `reify` inside audience's own tests. The
   module also shipped no `ig-config`, so the platform emitted its settings map
   and built neither the service nor the routes, and no schema component, so a
   booted app had no `audience_segments` table to write to.

   Each of those is invisible until something boots the module, which nothing
   did."
