== Boundary Framework Documentation

Welcome to the Boundary Framework documentation. This documentation
covers architecture, guides, API references, and implementation details
for the Boundary Framework - a module-centric software framework built
on Clojure that implements the "Functional Core / Imperative Shell"
architectural paradigm.
