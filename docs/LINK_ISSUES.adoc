== Known Documentation Link Issues

After the Antora removal, some internal links need attention. This file
documents known issues and their resolution status.

=== Link Categories

[[white_check_mark-fixed-17-links]]
==== ✅ Fixed (17 links)

* All `how-to/` and `concepts/` subdirectory references within guides/
* Cross-references between guides and reference sections
* Most internal documentation links

[[warning-needs-attention-36-links]]
==== ⚠️ Needs Attention (36 links)

===== Missing Referenced Files (Should exist but don't)

These files are referenced but not found in the new structure:

* `docs/validation-guide.adoc` - Referenced by ADR-005
* `docs/validation-patterns.adoc` - Already exists as
`docs/reference/validation-patterns.adoc`
* `docs/error-codes.adoc` - Already exists as
`docs/reference/error-codes.adoc`
* `docs/boundary.prd.adoc` - Should be at root level as `PRD.adoc`
* `docs/multi-db-usage.adoc` - Missing
* `docs/dynamic-driver-loading.adoc` - Missing

===== External to docs/ (Valid, pointing outside)

These are intentionally outside docs/ directory:

* `../PRD.adoc` → `/PRD.adoc` (project root)
* `../warp.md` → `/warp.md` (project root)
* `../src/boundary/shell/utils/port++_++manager.clj` (source code)
* `REFACTORING-SUMMARY.adoc`, `TEST-FIXES-SUMMARY.adoc` (project root)

===== Non-existent Subdirectories

Links expect old Antora structure with how-to/, concepts/, etc
subdirectories that no longer exist:

* `docs/guides/how-to/++*++.adoc` → should be `docs/guides/++*++.adoc`
* `docs/guides/concepts/++*++.adoc` → should be `docs/guides/++*++.adoc`

=== Recommended Actions

==== Immediate (High Priority)

[arabic]
. *Update ADR links* - Fix ADR files to use correct paths:
* `../validation-patterns.adoc` →
`../reference/validation-patterns.adoc`
* `../error-codes.adoc` → `../reference/error-codes.adoc`
* `../../warp.md` → `../../warp.md` (already correct, verify file
exists)
. *Fix PRD references* - Verify PRD.adoc location and update links

==== Medium Priority

[arabic, start=3]
. *Create or relocate missing files*:
* Find and move `validation-guide.adoc` if it exists
* Find and move `multi-db-usage.adoc` if it exists
* Find and move `dynamic-driver-loading.adoc` if it exists
. *Document external references* - Add note in docs/README.md about
files intentionally outside docs/

==== Low Priority (Optional)

[arabic, start=5]
. *Validate all external links* - Ensure links to source code files are
correct
. *Add link checking to CI* - Automate link validation

=== Running Link Checker

[source,bash]
----
python3 verify-doc-links.py
----

This will show all broken internal links within the docs/ directory.

=== Notes

* Links to files outside docs/ (in src/, root, etc.) are marked as
"broken" by the checker but may be intentional
* The link checker only validates internal documentation links, not
external URLs
* After fixing links, re-run the checker to verify
