Title: Boundary — batteries‑included Clojure web framework for teams

Tagline: Batteries included, boundaries enforced

We’re excited to share Boundary, a Clojure web framework that helps teams ship secure, observable apps fast — with clean architecture and zero frontend build step.

What’s in the box
- FC/IS architecture with Integrant lifecycle
- Server‑side rendering via Hiccup + HTMX
- Built‑in admin interface
- MFA out of the box
- Module scaffolding + Malli validation (snapshot tests)
- Multi‑layer observability (logging, metrics, error reporting)

Why it matters
- Opinionated defaults reduce weeks of glue work
- Typed errors and interceptors make failures actionable
- SSR keeps complexity low and performance high

Get started
- Quickstart: docs/launch/posts/quickstart.md
- Starter repo: https://github.com/thijs-creemers/boundary-starter
- 10–15 min demo: TODO:demo-video-url

We’d love feedback from folks building SaaS backends and internal tools. What would you want to see next?
