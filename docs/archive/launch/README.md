# Boundary Launch Materials

Tagline: Batteries included, boundaries enforced

This folder contains prepped content for the Boundary framework launch.

## Structure

- posts/
  - why-boundary.md — “Why Boundary” thought piece
  - quickstart.md — 10-minute getting started guide
- announcements/
  - clojureverse.md — ClojureVerse announcement draft
  - reddit.md — Reddit post draft
  - slack.md — Clojurians Slack announcement draft

## Next Steps

1. Provide starter repo and demo video URLs (replace TODO placeholders).
2. Create a starter repository (minimal template) and example app demo.
3. Record 10–15 min demo walkthrough: scaffold → admin → MFA → deploy.
4. Soft launch: Clojurians Slack + ClojureVerse, gather feedback.
5. Full launch: Reddit r/Clojure, optional Hacker News, newsletter outreach.

## Recommended Outreach Targets

- Clojurians Slack (#announcements, #web-dev, #beginners)
- ClojureVerse discussion
- r/Clojure (Reddit)
- Clojure mailing list
- Influencers/newsletters: Eric Normand, Brave Clojure, James Reeves, Sean Corfield

## Positioning Notes

Boundary is a batteries-included framework that enforces clean architecture (FC/IS), ships MFA and an admin interface out of the box, uses SSR via Hiccup + HTMX (no build step), and provides multi-layer observability. It’s aimed at teams building internal tools and SaaS backends who want to ship fast without sacrificing maintainability.
