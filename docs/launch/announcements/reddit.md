Title: Show HN-style: Boundary — Clojure framework with SSR/HTMX, MFA, and observability

Tagline: Batteries included, boundaries enforced

Boundary is a batteries‑included Clojure web framework designed for teams:
- FC/IS architecture + Integrant
- Hiccup + HTMX (no frontend build)
- Admin UI and MFA included
- Malli validation with snapshot testing
- Interceptor‑based logging/metrics/error reporting

Why try it?
- Ship faster with consistent patterns and fewer moving parts
- Strong defaults for security and observability
- Great fit for internal tools and back‑office apps
