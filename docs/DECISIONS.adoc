== User Guide Decisions

*Date:* 2025-01-06 +
*Status:* Active

=== Scope and Approach

==== Audience

*Primary:* Clojure developers new to Boundary +
*Secondary:* Platform engineers and API integrators with some Clojure
exposure

Non-Clojure engineers are supported through clear explanations and
references to learning resources, but the guide assumes basic Clojure
familiarity.

==== Operating System Support

* *macOS:* First-class support with Homebrew installation paths
* *Linux:* Callouts and alternative commands where different (apt-get,
curl installers)
* *Windows:* Out of scope for this iteration

==== Quickstart Flow

*Single guided path* covering both CLI and REST API:

* No branching or "choose your own adventure"
* 15-30 minute target completion time
* Tests → REPL → CLI → REST in sequence
* End with pointers to how-to guides for deeper topics

==== Documentation Structure

Following *Diátaxis framework*:

* *Tutorials:* Learning-oriented (quickstart)
* *How-to Guides:* Task-oriented (add entity, implement port, etc.)
* *Concepts:* Understanding-oriented (FC/IS, ports & adapters)
* *Reference:* Information-oriented (commands, config, error codes)
* *Troubleshooting:* Problem-solving oriented

==== Relationship with Existing Docs

* *warp.md:* Remains as "Developer Guide" for comprehensive reference
* *User Guide:* Complementary, focused on getting started and common
tasks
* *Cross-linking:* Prominent bidirectional links between both guides
* *No content moves:* This iteration adds to docs, doesn't relocate
warp.md content

==== Architecture Documentation

* *No duplication:* User guide xrefs to `docs/architecture/` for deep
dives
* *Concept summaries:* Brief explanations in user guide with "Learn
more" links
* *Shared attributes:* Reuse
`docs/architecture/++_++partials/attributes.adoc`

==== Build and Validation Tooling

* *Makefile:* Simple targets for `make docs` and `make links`
* *Scripts:* Alternative `scripts/docs-build.sh` for CI environments
* *Link checking:* Using `lychee` for external/internal link validation
* *AsciiDoc:* All new docs in `.adoc` format for consistency

==== Key Configuration Values

* *Repository:* `https://github.com/thijs-creemers/boundary`
* *Default API URL:* `http://localhost:3000`
* *Default database:* SQLite (`dev-database.db`)
* *REPL port:* 7888
* *Shell:* zsh (with bash alternatives where needed)

==== Security and Secrets

* *No secrets in docs:* Only placeholders and environment variable
references
* *Validation:* Grep patterns to catch accidental exposure before
commits
* *Examples:* Use `alice@example.com`, `UUID placeholders`, safe demo
data

==== Style Guidelines

* *Active voice:* "Run the tests" not "Tests should be run"
* *Concise steps:* Numbered lists for procedures
* *Code blocks:* Language-tagged (zsh, clojure, json)
* *Balanced parens:* All Clojure validated via clojure-mcp REPL
* *Indentation:* Respect parinfer conventions

=== Non-Goals (This Iteration)

* Antora-based documentation site
* Windows support
* Multiple quickstart paths
* Moving content from warp.md
* Comprehensive API reference (use Swagger/OpenAPI)
* Video tutorials or screencasts

=== Future Enhancements (Post-Merge)

* CI integration for docs build {plus} link check
* Generate parts of reference docs from code (deps.edn → commands.adoc)
* Collect onboarding feedback and iterate
* Consider Antora migration for full documentation portal
