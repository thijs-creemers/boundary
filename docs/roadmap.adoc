= Boundary Framework Roadmap
:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:icons: font

Boundary is approaching public readiness. This roadmap focuses on *quick release*, *developer adoption*, and *a smooth path to 1.0*. It avoids unnecessary feature expansion and prioritizes clarity, stability, and developer experience.

== Phase 0 — Alpha (Immediate Release)
*Goal: Make Boundary usable for early adopters with minimal friction.*

=== Objectives
- Freeze core APIs (FC/IS, Interceptors, Normalized Routing).
- Provide a complete beginner-focused developer journey.
- Publish the framework publicly for early feedback.

=== Deliverables
1. Normalize all modules to the new routing system.
2. Update the scaffolder to generate:
- normalized routes
- interceptor hooks
- minimal CRUD stubs
3. Starter Project Template (`boundary-starter`):
- User + Inventory modules
- Login flow, CRUD example, minimal UI
4. Minimal documentation set:
- *Getting Started* (5 minutes)
- *Your First Module* (20 minutes)
- *Understanding FC/IS in Boundary*
5. Public release:
- GitHub repository open
- Clojars deployment
- Announcement on Clojurian Slack & Reddit

=== Notes
- Boundary is already technically mature; Alpha is about clarity, not features.
- Focus on lowering friction for new developers.

---

== Phase 1 — Beta (Developer Productivity & Confidence)
*Goal: Make Boundary comfortable and delightful to build real-world applications.*

=== Objectives
- Improve day-to-day development experience.
- Provide practical, real-world examples.
- Strengthen web UI and CLI tooling.

=== Deliverables
1. CRUD Web UI for the User module:
- Create, Edit, Delete
- Uses HTMX patterns
2. Example Interceptors:
- Authentication
- Audit Logging
- Rate Limiting
3. Scaffolder Improvements:
- Optional UI generation flags
- REST + CLI enhancements
4. Example Applications:
- Simple CRM (Users + Items + Sessions)
- Inventory Tracker
5. Documentation Expansion:
- Error handling guide
- Observability quickstart
- CI/CD templates (Docker, Fly.io, Heroku)
6. Basic Admin UX Patterns:
- Forms, tables, pagination, layout guidance

=== Notes
- Beta is where developers realize: *“I can build production apps with this.”*
- Examples matter more than new features.

---

== Phase 2 — v1.0 (Stability & Production Readiness)
*Goal: Make Boundary fully reliable and attractive for company-level adoption.*

=== Objectives
- Build trust through stability and polish.
- Provide migration and integration tooling.
- Improve operational and security guidance.

=== Deliverables
1. Migration Tooling:
- Reitit → Boundary normalized routing
- Django/Rails coexistence cookbook
- Database migration best practices
2. Admin UI Template:
- CRUD component library
- Authentication-aware layouts
3. Security & Operations:
- Security checklist
- Health checks
- Deployment patterns and reference configs
4. Advanced Observability:
- Datadog metrics provider
- Request/session dashboards
5. Performance Baseline:
- CRUD benchmarks
- Scaling & tuning recommendations

=== Notes
- This phase turns Boundary from “promising” → “production-ready.”
- Focus on reliability, documentation, and safe defaults.

---

== Phase 3 — Ecosystem Expansion (Post-1.0)
*Goal: Build a vibrant Boundary ecosystem and optional advanced capabilities.*

=== Potential Deliverables
- Datomic / XTDB backend integration
- Optional Workflow / Actor engine
- Boundary SaaS Starter Kit (login, billing, admin)
- Extension marketplace
- Application templates:
- API-only
- Admin dashboard
- SaaS boilerplate

=== Notes
- None of these items block adoption or 1.0.
- These features accelerate long-term growth.

== Roadmap Summary

| Phase | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| *Alpha* | Quick release, scaffolder, starter template, minimal docs | Early adopters can build apps immediately |
| *Beta* | Developer productivity, examples, web UI | Developers gain confidence and comfort |
| *v1.0* | Stability, migration, operational readiness | Companies can use Boundary in production |
| *Ecosystem* | Long-term enhancements | Boundary becomes a complete platform |

---

== Strategic Notes

=== 1. Focus on onboarding, not architectural depth
Boundary already has deep documentation. What’s missing is a guided, narrative experience for beginners.

=== 2. Use the Scaffolder as your flagship feature
Boundary’s scaffolder is a key differentiator. It should define the developer workflow from day one.

=== 3. Avoid overbuilding pre-release
Modules like Billing and Workflow are not required to ship 1.0. Keep them out of the critical path.

=== 4. Publish early, iterate publicly
The framework is already more mature than most early-stage OSS releases. Early feedback accelerates correctness.

---

== Next Review
This roadmap is intended as a living document. Revisit every 2–3 weeks to adjust scope and priorities as adoption grows.
