# ADR-002: Implement `boundary new` Command in Scaffolder

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Deciders:** Sisyphus-Junior  
**Context:** Project Bootstrapping  

---

## Context and Problem Statement

The Boundary framework currently provides a powerful scaffolder for adding modules to existing projects, but lacks a built-in mechanism for bootstrapping new projects. Users are currently expected to manually clone a starter repository or copy files. 

To improve the "Time to First Hello World" and ensure consistent project structure, we need a `boundary new` command that can generate a fresh project based on the standardized Boundary architecture (Functional Core / Imperative Shell).

Additionally, an audit of the current CLI reveals "documentation drift": the `libs/scaffolder/README.md` documents `--output-dir` and `--force` flags for the `generate` command, but these are not implemented in `libs/scaffolder/src/boundary/scaffolder/cli.clj`.

---

## Decision Drivers

- **Ease of Adoption**: Minimize friction for new users starting their first Boundary project.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all new projects follow the latest architectural patterns (FC/IS, Integrant wiring).
- **Extensibility**: The CLI should be easy to extend without significant refactoring.
- **Maintenance**: Address existing documentation drift to ensure the tool behaves as advertised.

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Standalone Bootstrap Script
A separate shell script or Clojure script to clone the starter repo.
- **Pros**: Zero impact on existing scaffolder code.
- **Cons**: Fragmented user experience; harder to maintain as part of the framework.

### Option 2: Extend Scaffolder CLI ✅ SELECTED
Add a `new` command to the existing `boundary.scaffolder.cli`.
- **Pros**: Leverages existing CLI infrastructure, validation patterns, and service ports. Provides a unified tool for all scaffolding needs.
- **Cons**: Increases the size of `cli.clj`.

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 2: Extend Scaffolder CLI

We will extend the `boundary.scaffolder.cli` namespace to support a `new` command. This extension is feasible and clean due to the existing command dispatch pattern.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Extension Point
The command will be added to `dispatch-command` in `libs/scaffolder/src/boundary/scaffolder/cli.clj` (around line 424):

```clojure
(defn dispatch-command [verb opts service]
  (case verb
    :generate (execute-generate service opts)
    :new      (execute-new service opts) ; New case
    :field    (execute-field service opts)
    ;; ...
    ))
```

#### 2. New Functions and Definitions
To maintain consistency with existing commands, we will add:
- `new-options`: Definition of CLI flags (`--name`, `--output-dir`, `--force`, `--dry-run`).
- `validate-new-options`: Validation logic for project names and paths.
- `execute-new`: Orchestration function that calls the service port.

#### 3. Estimated Effort
- **Estimated LOC**: 150-200 lines of Clojure code in `cli.clj`.
- **New Port**: `ports/generate-project` (to be implemented in the service layer).

#### 4. Addressing Documentation Drift
During the implementation of Phase 2, the following missing flags must be added to `generate-options` and `new-options` to match the documentation:
- `--output-dir`: Specify where files are written (defaulting to current directory).
- `--force`: Overwrite existing files if they exist.

---

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Unified CLI**: Users have a single entry point for all scaffolding tasks.
- **Batteries Included**: Project bootstrapping becomes a first-class feature.
- **Correct Documentation**: The tool will finally match its README.

### Negative Consequences
- **Code Growth**: `cli.clj` is already ~760 lines and will grow to ~950 lines.
- **Service Layer Complexity**: The scaffolder service will need new logic for project-level templates.

---

## Verification Plan

1. **Audit Completion**: This ADR confirms that the `cli.clj` structure is highly amenable to this extension.
2. **Implementation Verification**:
   - `lsp_diagnostics` must remain clean.
   - New tests in `libs/scaffolder/test/boundary/scaffolder/shell/cli_test.clj` should verify the `new` command dispatch.
   - Manual verification of `--output-dir` and `--force` flags.
