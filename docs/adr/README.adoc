== Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting
significant architectural decisions made during the development of the
Boundary Framework.

=== What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions
along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes:

* *Context*: The situation and problem being addressed
* *Decision*: The chosen solution and approach
* *Status*: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
* *Consequences*: Implications and trade-offs of the decision

=== Current ADRs

==== ADR-005: Validation DevEx Foundations

ADR-005-validation-devex-foundations.adoc

Establishes the foundation for an excellent validation developer
experience using Malli schemas, with clear separation between core and
shell layers.

*Key Decisions:*

* Malli for schema definition and validation
* Validation at shell layer boundaries
* Pure core functions receive validated data
* Consistent error reporting structure

[[adr-006-web-ui-architecture-htmx--hiccup]]
==== ADR-006: Web UI Architecture (HTMX {plus} Hiccup)

ADR-006-web-ui-architecture-htmx-hiccup.adoc

Defines the web UI architecture using server-side rendering with HTMX
for progressive enhancement and Hiccup for HTML generation.

*Key Decisions:*

* Server-side rendering (no separate frontend build)
* HTMX for dynamic interactions
* Hiccup for HTML generation in core layer
* Module-integrated UI code

==== ADR-007: Routing Architecture

ADR-007-routing-architecture.adoc

Documents the routing architecture using Reitit with module-based route
composition.

*Key Decisions:*

* Reitit for HTTP routing
* Module-level route definitions
* Route composition in system wiring
* Consistent route structure across modules

*Note*: Change reports in `link:../change-reports/[change-reports/]` often document the implementation details of decisions made in ADRs. For example, `ROUTING_REARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` details the implementation of ADR-007.

=== ADR Process

When making significant architectural decisions:

[arabic]
. Create a new ADR file following the numbering convention
. Use the ADR template structure (Context, Decision, Status,
Consequences)
. Discuss with the team before finalizing
. Update this README with a summary
. Reference the ADR in relevant code and documentation
