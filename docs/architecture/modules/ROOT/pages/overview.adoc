== Architectural Philosophy

=== Module-Centric Architecture Foundation

Boundary is built on a **module-centric architecture** where each domain module owns its complete functionality stack, from pure business logic to external interfaces. This approach creates highly composable, testable, and maintainable systems that can evolve into reusable development toolchains.

**Strategic Vision**: Boundary serves as both a framework for building applications and a **foundation for creating reusable development toolchains**:

* **Library Extraction**: Core infrastructure extractable into reusable libraries (`boundary-core`)
* **Template Generation**: Automated module scaffolding with consistent patterns (`boundary-gen`)
* **Domain Frameworks**: Specialized frameworks for different industries
* **Module Marketplace**: Shareable, installable modules for common functionality

**Complete Domain Ownership**: Each module (`user`, `billing`, `workflow`) contains:

- Pure business logic (functional core)
- Port definitions and schemas
- HTTP, CLI, and WebSocket interfaces
- Service orchestration components
- Adapter implementations
- Feature flag integration

=== Module-Centric Package Structure

Boundary's module-centric architecture is reflected in a clear package organization where each domain module owns its complete functionality stack:

**Key Architectural Benefits:**

* **Complete Domain Ownership**: Each module (`user/`, `billing/`, `workflow/`) contains everything needed for that domain
* **Scalable Development**: Teams can work independently on different modules without conflicts
* **Feature Flag Integration**: Entire modules can be enabled/disabled via configuration
* **Clear Boundaries**: Related code is co-located, unrelated code is separated
* **Strategic Evolution**: Modules can be extracted as independent libraries (`boundary-core`)

=== The Functional Core / Imperative Shell Paradigm

Within each module, Boundary implements the FC/IS architectural pattern, which provides a clear separation between:

**Functional Core** (Pure Business Logic)::
* Contains only deterministic functions with no side effects
* Focuses exclusively on business rules, calculations, and domain logic  
* Depends only on abstract interfaces (ports), never concrete implementations
* Produces immutable data structures as outputs
* Enables comprehensive unit testing without mocks

**Imperative Shell** (Infrastructure & I/O)::
* Handles all side effects: database operations, HTTP requests, file I/O, logging
* Validates and coerces input data before passing to core functions
* Implements concrete adapters for abstract ports
* Translates core outputs to appropriate interface formats
* Manages configuration, error handling, and operational concerns

=== Benefits of FC/IS Architecture

**Testability**::
* Core functions are pure and require no mocks or test doubles
* Business logic can be tested in isolation with simple input/output verification
* Integration tests focus on adapter implementations and I/O boundaries

**Maintainability**::
* Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
* Business logic changes don't affect infrastructure code and vice versa
* New interfaces (REST, CLI, Web) can be added without changing core logic

**Reliability**::
* Pure functions are deterministic and eliminate entire classes of bugs
* Side effects are contained and explicitly managed
* Error handling is consistent across all interfaces

== System Architecture Overview

=== High-Level System Context

.Boundary Framework - C4 Container View
image::{diagrams-dir}/c4-container.png[C4 Container Diagram, 800]

The system serves three distinct user types through separate interfaces while maintaining a unified architectural core:

**External Users:**

* **API Consumers**: Developers and systems integrating via REST endpoints
* **Operators**: System administrators using CLI for management and automation
* **End Users**: Business users interacting through the web interface

**Core Containers:**

* **Functional Core**: Pure Clojure functions containing business logic
* **Imperative Shell**: Side-effect handling layer managing validation, I/O, and infrastructure
* **External Systems**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Email services for notifications

=== Component Interaction Overview

.Framework Component Architecture
image::{diagrams-dir}system-component-overview.png[Component Overview, 800]

The component diagram illustrates the key architectural elements:

**Presentation Layer**::
* **REST API** (Ring/Reitit): JSON-based HTTP endpoints
* **CLI** (tools.cli): Command-line interface for operations
* **Web Frontend** (ClojureScript/Replicant): Interactive user interface

**Imperative Shell Layer**::
* **Validation** (Malli): Schema-based input validation and coercion
* **Error Translation**: Converts core errors to interface-appropriate formats
* **Configuration** (Aero): Environment-based configuration management
* **Logging** (TeleMere): Structured logging and telemetry
* **Adapters**: Concrete implementations for databases, email, external APIs
* **Ports**: Abstract interfaces (Clojure protocols) defining capabilities

**Functional Core**::
* **Domain Functions**: Pure business logic for specific domains (users, jobs, etc.)
* **Business Rules Engine**: Configurable rules and decision logic
* **Data Transformations**: Pure functions for data processing and calculations

== Architectural Principles and Rules

=== Dependency Flow Rules

Boundary enforces strict dependency rules to maintain architectural integrity:

[cols="2,1,3"]
|===
|Dependency Direction |Status |Rule

|**Presentation → Shell** |✅ Allowed |All interfaces depend on shell for I/O handling
|**Shell → Core** |✅ Allowed |Shell calls core functions with validated data
|**Core → Ports** |✅ Allowed |Core depends only on abstract interfaces
|**Shell → Adapters** |✅ Allowed |Shell provides concrete implementations
|**Core → Shell** |❌ Forbidden |Core never depends on shell or infrastructure
|**Core → Adapters** |❌ Forbidden |Core never depends on concrete implementations
|**Ports → Adapters** |❌ Forbidden |Abstractions don't depend on implementations
|===

=== Layer Boundaries and Responsibilities

**Functional Core Constraints:**

* ✅ Pure functions only - no side effects whatsoever
* ✅ Deterministic behavior - same input always produces same output
* ✅ Immutable data structures for inputs and outputs
* ✅ Domain-focused logic only - calculations, rules, transformations
* ❌ No I/O operations - no database, network, file system access
* ❌ No time-dependent operations - no `(System/currentTimeMillis)`
* ❌ No logging or other side effects

**Imperative Shell Responsibilities:**

* ✅ All side effects - I/O, logging, configuration, external calls
* ✅ Input validation and type coercion using Malli schemas
* ✅ Error handling and translation to appropriate formats
* ✅ Adapter implementations and dependency injection
* ✅ Cross-cutting concerns - security, audit logging, metrics
* ❌ No business logic or domain calculations
* ❌ No business rule decisions based on data content

== Key Architectural Decisions

=== ADR-001: Functional Core / Imperative Shell Pattern

**Decision:** Implement strict FC/IS separation with pure core functions and side-effect handling in shell.

**Rationale:**

* Enables comprehensive testing of business logic without infrastructure dependencies
* Provides clear separation of concerns between domain logic and technical implementation
* Facilitates multiple interface implementations (REST, CLI, Web) with consistent behavior
* Reduces complexity by isolating side effects to shell boundaries

**Trade-offs:**
* **Positive**: High testability, maintainability, reliability
* **Negative**: Requires discipline to maintain boundaries, potential performance overhead

**Status:** ✅ Adopted

=== ADR-002: Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture)

**Decision:** Use Clojure protocols as ports and concrete implementations as adapters.

**Rationale:**

* Enables dependency inversion - core depends on abstractions, not implementations
* Facilitates testing with mock implementations
* Allows swapping implementations (e.g., PostgreSQL vs H2 for testing)
* Supports multiple deployment configurations

**Trade-offs:**
* **Positive**: Flexible, testable, supports multiple implementations
* **Negative**: Additional abstraction layer, requires interface design discipline

**Status:** ✅ Adopted

=== ADR-003: Multi-Interface Consistency

**Decision:** Ensure identical behavior across REST API, CLI, and Web interfaces.

**Rationale:**
* Provides predictable experience for users across different interaction modes
* Simplifies documentation and support
* Enables gradual migration between interfaces
* Validates architectural consistency

**Trade-offs:**
* **Positive**: Consistent user experience, architectural validation
* **Negative**: May constrain interface-specific optimizations

**Status:** ✅ Adopted

=== ADR-004: Schema-First Validation with Malli

**Decision:** Use Malli for all input validation and data transformation at shell boundaries.

**Rationale:**
* Provides runtime validation with compile-time schema definitions
* Enables automatic coercion (string "123" → integer 123)
* Generates clear, actionable error messages
* Supports schema composition and reuse across interfaces

**Trade-offs:**
* **Positive**: Type safety, clear errors, schema reuse
* **Negative**: Learning curve, schema maintenance overhead

**Status:** ✅ Adopted

== Cross-Cutting Concerns

=== Configuration Management

* **Environment-based configuration** using Aero with profile overlays
* **No secrets in code** - externalized through environment variables
* **Configuration validation** at application startup
* **Immutable configuration** passed through dependency injection

=== Error Handling Strategy

* **Domain errors** returned as data structures from core functions
* **Infrastructure errors** handled in shell with appropriate logging
* **Consistent error formats** across all interfaces (RFC 7807 for HTTP)
* **Correlation IDs** for request tracing across system boundaries

=== Observability and Monitoring

* **Structured logging** with TeleMere and tools.logging
* **Request/response logging** at interface boundaries
* **Performance metrics** collection at adapter boundaries
* **Health checks** for external dependencies
