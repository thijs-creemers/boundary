= Example Applications

Complete, working applications that demonstrate Boundary's patterns in practice.

== Overview

Each example is a standalone application you can run, explore, and learn from. They progress from simple to complex, each introducing new concepts.

== Running the Examples

All examples live in the `examples/` directory of the main repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/thijs-creemers/boundary
cd boundary/examples
----

Each example has its own `deps.edn` and can be run independently:

[source,bash]
----
cd todo-api
clojure -M -m todo.main
----

== What Each Example Demonstrates

=== Todo API — The Basics

The classic starting point. Build a REST API with:

* CRUD operations following FC/IS pattern
* JWT authentication
* Input validation with Malli schemas
* SQLite persistence

_Start here if you're new to Boundary._

=== Blog Application — Server-Side Rendering

A complete web application with:

* Hiccup templates for HTML generation
* HTMX for dynamic interactions without JavaScript
* Pico CSS for minimal styling
* Session-based authentication

_Demonstrates that Boundary isn't just for APIs._

=== E-commerce API — Real-World Complexity

A production-style API showcasing:

* Order state machine (pending → paid → shipped → delivered)
* Mock Stripe payment provider
* Webhook signature verification
* Multiple interconnected modules (product, cart, order, payment)

_Shows how modules communicate via protocols._

=== Notification Service — Event-Driven Architecture

A microservice demonstrating:

* In-memory pub/sub message bus
* Event handlers for different event types
* Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push)
* Exponential backoff retry logic

_Illustrates patterns for distributed systems._

== Common Patterns Across Examples
