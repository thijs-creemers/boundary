== Architecture Documentation

This section contains comprehensive architectural documentation for the
Boundary Framework, covering design principles, patterns, and technical
implementations.

=== Core Architecture

==== Foundational Patterns

* link:overview.adoc[*Overview*] - High-level architecture overview and
key concepts
