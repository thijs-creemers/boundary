This document tracks all required steps to release the Boundary Framework Alpha publicly.
The goal is to deliver a stable, approachable, minimal-but-complete version of Boundary for early adopters.

== 1. Core System Readiness

=== 1.1 Architecture Freeze
- [ ] Freeze FC/IS architecture contracts.
- [ ] Freeze normalized routing schema.
- [ ] Freeze interceptor pipeline semantics (enter/leave/error).
- [ ] Mark any experimental namespaces with clear annotations.

=== 1.2 Module Review
- [ ] User module verified with normalized routes.
- [ ] Inventory module verified with normalized routes.
- [ ] User and Inventory modules marked as *experimental* or excluded from release bundles.

=== 1.3 Remove Deprecated Code
- [ ] Remove all legacy routing functions.
- [ ] Remove unused namespaces.
- [ ] Confirm no references to pre-normalized routing APIs remain.
- [ ] Ensure error messages reference the correct API surfaces.

== 2. Scaffolder Readiness

=== 2.1 Route Generation
- [ ] Scaffolder outputs normalized route format.
- [ ] Generated routes include default interceptor hooks.

=== 2.2 Module Structure
- [ ] Generated modules compile without errors.
- [ ] Generated modules follow FC/IS conventions.
- [ ] Generated tests run and pass out of the box.

=== 2.3 Integration
- [ ] Scaffolder output integrates cleanly into the starter template.
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md or equivalent with scaffolder usage instructions.

== 3. Starter Template

=== 3.1 Project Structure
- [ ] Create `boundary-starter` GitHub repository.
- [ ] Include User + Inventory modules.
- [ ] Include login/logout functionality.
- [ ] Include a minimal CRUD flow (HTMX UI is enough).

=== 3.2 Developer Experience
- [ ] One-command startup (`clojure -M:dev`).
- [ ] One-command test (`clojure -M:test`).
- [ ] Default dev configuration fully working.
- [ ] Provide seed data OR a short guide to creating first records.

=== 3.3 Documentation in Repo
- [ ] README with clear “Getting Started” steps.
- [ ] Architecture overview (very short).
- [ ] Link to full Boundary docs site.

== 4. Documentation

=== 4.1 Essential Guides
- [ ] Getting Started (5-minute guide).
- [ ] Create Your First Module (20-minute tutorial).
- [ ] Understanding FC/IS in Boundary (high-level explanation).
- [ ] Quick guide to normalized routing.
- [ ] Quick guide to interceptors.

=== 4.2 API Documentation
- [ ] Document public namespaces only.
- [ ] Add notes for any unstable API sections.

=== 4.3 Docs Website
- [ ] Ensure Hugo/Geekdoc site builds correctly.
- [ ] Publish the Alpha roadmap.
- [ ] Add navigation entry: “Alpha Release Notes”.

== 5. Quality & Testing

=== 5.1 Automated Tests
- [ ] Full test suite passes across all modules.
- [ ] Test coverage acceptable for Alpha (no need for 100%).

=== 5.2 Manual QA
- [ ] Boot Boundary REPL manually and run through:
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Create item
- [ ] Edit item
- [ ] List items
- [ ] Error messages (e.g., invalid input)
- [ ] Validate HTTP error responses follow RFC 7807.

=== 5.3 Cross-DB Test (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Run starter project with SQLite.
- [ ] Run starter project with PostgreSQL.

== 6. Packaging & Release Infrastructure

=== 6.1 GitHub
- [ ] Create public repository.
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (MIT or EPL recommended).
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING guide.
- [ ] Add issue templates (bug, enhancement, question).
- [ ] Enable Discussions.

=== 6.2 Clojars
- [ ] Publish Boundary core.
- [ ] Publish Boundary scaffolder.
- [ ] Publish Boundary starter template (if applicable).

=== 6.3 Versioning
- [ ] Tag version: `v0.1.0-alpha`.
- [ ] Add Release Notes in GitHub.

== 7. Announcement & Visibility

=== 7.1 Channels
- [ ] Post introduction on Clojurian Slack (#clojure, #announcements).
- [ ] Post introduction on r/Clojure.
- [ ] Publish a short blog post:
- What Boundary is
- Why FC/IS matters
- Why normalized routing is powerful
- How to get started quickly

=== 7.2 Pitch
Use this summary:

----
Boundary is a modern Functional Core / Imperative Shell framework for Clojure.
It offers normalized routing, declarative interceptors, production-ready scaffolding,
enterprise-grade validation, and a clean development workflow.
Alpha is ready to try today.
----

== 8. Post-Release Checklist (first 72 hours)

- [ ] Monitor GitHub Issues.
- [ ] Clarify documentation gaps noticed by users.
- [ ] Patch any release-blocking bugs.
- [ ] Add a FAQ section based on early feedback.
- [ ] Start recruiting early adopters and contributors.

== Completion Criteria

Boundary Alpha is considered *successfully released* when:

- [ ] Developers can clone the starter template and build a working CRUD app in under 10 minutes.
- [ ] Scaffolder produces fully functional modules with normalized routing.
- [ ] Documentation is sufficient for a newcomer to understand and build basic features.
- [ ] Public visibility has been achieved through Slack, Reddit, and GitHub.
