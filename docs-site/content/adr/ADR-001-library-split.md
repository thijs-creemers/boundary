# ADR-001: Split Boundary Monolith into Modular Libraries

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Deciders:** Boundary Core Team  
**Context:** Planning Phase  

---

## Context and Problem Statement

The Boundary framework currently exists as a monolithic codebase where all components (user management, admin interface, platform infrastructure, utilities) are tightly bundled. While this simplifies initial development, it creates several problems for external adoption and long-term maintainability:

1. **All-or-Nothing Dependency**: Users must include the entire framework even if they only need core utilities or database infrastructure
2. **Difficult to Extend**: Third-party developers cannot easily depend on specific Boundary components without pulling in unrelated code
3. **Publishing Challenges**: Cannot publish to Clojars as a single artifact without bloating user dependencies
4. **Maintenance Complexity**: Changes to core utilities require releasing entire framework
5. **Limited Flexibility**: Users who want custom authentication cannot easily swap out the user module while keeping platform infrastructure

The goal is to transform Boundary from an application into a **framework foundation** that others can build upon, while maintaining the cohesive "batteries-included" experience for users who want the full stack.

---

## Decision Drivers

### Technical Drivers
- **Modularity**: Enable dependency on individual components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between infrastructure, domain logic, and utilities
- **Extensibility**: Third-party modules should integrate seamlessly
- **Performance**: No degradation from modular architecture

### User Experience Drivers
- **Ease of Adoption**: Simple getting-started path for new users
- **Flexibility**: Advanced users can pick and choose components
- **Migration Path**: Existing users can upgrade without major rewrites
- **Documentation**: Clear understanding of what each library provides

### Operational Drivers
- **Maintainability**: Independent versioning and testing of components
- **Release Velocity**: Update individual libraries without coordinated releases
- **Community Contributions**: Clear entry points for contributors
- **Long-term Evolution**: Architecture that supports growth

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Keep Monolith (Status Quo)

**Structure:**
- Single repository
- Single artifact: `boundary/boundary`
- All components bundled together

**Pros:**
- No migration needed
- Simple dependency management
- Easy coordinated releases
- Works well for internal use

**Cons:**
- Cannot publish to Clojars effectively (too large)
- Users must depend on everything
- No flexibility for custom implementations
- Difficult for third-party extensions
- Maintenance complexity grows with size

**Verdict:** ❌ Rejected - Does not support open-source distribution goals

---

### Option 2: Coarse-Grained Split (3 Libraries)

**Structure:**
```
boundary/boundary        - Everything (platform + modules + utils)
boundary/boundary-dev    - Development tools only
boundary/boundary-cli    - CLI tools only
```

**Pros:**
- Simple dependency graph
- Easy version coordination
- Minimal migration effort
- Low maintenance overhead

**Cons:**
- Still all-or-nothing for most users
- Cannot customize authentication without forking
- Large dependency footprint
- Limited flexibility

**Verdict:** ❌ Rejected - Insufficient modularity

---

### Option 3: Fine-Grained Split (10+ Libraries)

**Structure:**
```
boundary/core            - Minimal utilities
boundary/database        - Database adapters only
boundary/http            - HTTP routing only
boundary/pagination      - Pagination only
boundary/search          - Search only
boundary/logging         - Logging only
boundary/metrics         - Metrics only
boundary/errors          - Error reporting only
boundary/user            - User management
boundary/admin           - Admin interface
boundary/storage         - File storage
boundary/external        - External services
boundary/scaffolder      - Code generator
```

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility
- Smallest possible dependencies
- Independent versioning
- Granular testing

**Cons:**
- Complex dependency graph
- Version coordination nightmare
- Steeper learning curve
- Higher maintenance burden
- Many artifacts to publish

**Verdict:** ❌ Rejected - Too complex for practical use

---

### Option 4: Medium-Grained Split (8 Libraries) ✅ SELECTED

**Structure:**
```
boundary/core            - Validation, utils, interceptors
boundary/observability   - Logging, metrics, error reporting
boundary/platform        - Database, HTTP, pagination, search
boundary/user            - User management, auth, MFA
boundary/admin           - Admin CRUD + shared UI
boundary/storage         - File storage adapters
boundary/external        - External service adapters
boundary/scaffolder      - Code generation tool
```

**Pros:**
- Good balance of modularity and simplicity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Logical dependency hierarchy
- Manageable maintenance overhead
- Users can choose infrastructure vs full stack
- Reasonable number of artifacts (~8)

**Cons:**
- Some version coordination needed
- Migration required for existing users
- More repos/artifacts than monolith

**Verdict:** ✅ **SELECTED** - Best balance of all factors

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Medium-Grained Split (8 Libraries)

We will split Boundary into 8 independently publishable Clojars artifacts with the following dependency hierarchy:

```
                    Application Code
                         │
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        │                │                │
    admin            user           scaffolder
        │                │                │
        └────────┬───────┘                │
                 │                        │
              platform                    │
                 │                        │
           observability                  │
                 │                        │
                 └────────────────────────┘
                              │
                            core
```

### Rationale

1. **Core Infrastructure Grouping**: Platform groups together tightly-coupled infrastructure (database, HTTP, pagination, search) that most users want together

2. **Observability as Unified Stack**: Logging, metrics, and error reporting are typically configured together and have similar adapter patterns

3. **Domain Modules Stay Separate**: User and admin are distinct features that users may want independently

4. **Specialized Libraries Separated**: Storage and external service adapters are optional for many applications

5. **Dev Tools Isolated**: Scaffolder has no runtime dependencies and should be a dev-only dependency

### Implementation Strategy

**Repository Structure:** Monorepo
- Single GitHub repository with `libs/` directory
- Coordinated releases with synchronized versions
- Unified CI/CD pipeline
- Examples and documentation in same repo

**Publishing Strategy:**
- Group ID: `boundary` (fallback to `io.github.boundary` if unavailable)
- Synchronized versioning: All libs share version number (e.g., `0.1.0`)
- Initial release as `0.x.x` to allow breaking changes
- Post-1.0: Standard semantic versioning guarantees

**Module Registration:**
- Dynamic module registration pattern to avoid hard-coded dependencies
- Modules self-register on namespace load
- Platform provides registry and discovery mechanism

---

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Flexibility for Users**
   - Use full framework: `{boundary/admin {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}`
   - Platform only: `{boundary/platform {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}`
   - Core utils only: `{boundary/core {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}`

2. **Clear Extension Points**
   - Third-party modules can depend on `boundary/platform`
   - Custom auth implementations can replace `boundary/user`
   - Custom admin interfaces can use `boundary/ui` components

3. **Better Testing**
   - Each library can be tested independently
   - Integration tests verify cross-library compatibility
   - CI runs faster with parallel testing

4. **Improved Documentation**
   - Each library has focused documentation
   - Clear API boundaries
   - Easier to understand what each component does

5. **Community Growth**
   - Lower barrier to contribution (focus on one library)
   - Third-party ecosystem can flourish
   - Clear ownership boundaries

### Negative Consequences

1. **Migration Required**
   - Existing users must update namespace requires
   - Module registration pattern changes
   - Some workflow changes (explicit module loading)

2. **Version Coordination**
   - All libraries must be released together
   - Dependency updates affect multiple libraries
   - Testing across libraries required

3. **Increased Complexity**
   - More artifacts to publish
   - More documentation to maintain
   - Learning curve for library structure

4. **Initial Setup Overhead**
   - 6 weeks of focused work required
   - Testing across all libraries
   - Documentation updates

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Migration:**
- Comprehensive migration guide with before/after examples
- Automated migration script for namespace renames
- Example applications demonstrating new structure
- Support channel for migration questions

**For Complexity:**
- Clear dependency diagram in documentation
- Starter templates with common configurations
- Single "get everything" dependency option (`boundary/admin`)

**For Maintenance:**
- Automated release process
- Coordinated version bumping script
- CI pipeline for cross-library testing
- Monorepo structure for easier development

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Module Registration

**Problem:** Platform library cannot hard-code requires for domain modules (creates circular dependency).

**Solution:** Module self-registration pattern:

```clojure
;; In boundary.platform.system.modules (platform library)
(defonce registered-modules (atom {}))

(defn register-module! [module-key wiring-ns-sym]
  (swap! registered-modules assoc module-key wiring-ns-sym))

(defn load-registered-modules! []
  (doseq [[_ ns-sym] @registered-modules]
    (require ns-sym)))

;; In boundary.user.shell.module-wiring (user library)
(ns boundary.user.shell.module-wiring
  (:require [boundary.platform.system.modules :as modules]))

;; Self-register on namespace load
(modules/register-module! :user 'boundary.user.shell.module-wiring)

;; In application code
(ns myapp.main
  (:require [boundary.user.shell.module-wiring]  ; Triggers registration
            [boundary.platform.system.wiring]))   ; Uses registered modules
```

### Namespace Renames

**Breaking Changes:**

| Old | New | Reason |
|-----|-----|--------|
| `boundary.shared.core.*` | `boundary.core.*` | "shared" is unclear; "core" indicates foundation |
| `boundary.shared.ui.*` | `boundary.ui.*` | Move to admin library, remove "shared" |
| `boundary.logging.*` | `boundary.observability.logging.*` | Group with metrics/errors |
| `boundary.metrics.*` | `boundary.observability.metrics.*` | Group with logging/errors |
| `boundary.error_reporting.*` | `boundary.observability.errors.*` | Group with logging/metrics |

**Non-Breaking:**
- `boundary.platform.*` stays the same
- `boundary.user.*` stays the same
- `boundary.admin.*` stays the same

### Dependency Management

**Development (Monorepo):**
```clojure
;; Use :local/root for development
{:deps {boundary/core {:local/root "../core"}
        boundary/platform {:local/root "../platform"}}}
```

**Production (Published):**
```clojure
;; Use :mvn/version for production
{:deps {boundary/core {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}
        boundary/platform {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}}
```

**Build Process:**
- Script updates all `:local/root` to `:mvn/version` before publishing
- Verifies all version numbers match
- Runs full test suite before publishing

## Alternatives Considered and Rejected

### Git Submodules Approach

Use git submodules for each library in separate repos.

**Rejected because:**
- Complex workflow for contributors
- Difficult to test cross-repo changes
- Version coordination nightmare
- Submodule management is error-prone

### Leiningen Multi-Project

Use Leiningen's checkouts or multi-project features.

**Rejected because:**
- tools.deps is now standard for Clojure
- Better CI/CD integration with deps.edn
- Simpler dependency management

### Single Artifact with Exclusions

Publish single artifact but allow users to exclude namespaces.

**Rejected because:**
- Cannot exclude transitive dependencies
- Still bundles everything in artifact
- No true modularity

## Notes

### Open Questions

1. **Clojars Group Name**: Is `boundary` available? Fallback to `io.github.boundary`
2. **Version Strategy Post-1.0**: Should libraries version independently after 1.0?
3. **Database Driver Strategy**: Should platform bundle a default driver?
4. **UI Component Library**: Should `boundary.ui` become a separate library?

### Future Considerations

1. **Plugin System**: Consider formal plugin API for third-party modules
2. **Version Independence**: Post-1.0, evaluate decoupling library versions
3. **Additional Libraries**: 
   - `boundary/jobs` for background job processing
   - `boundary/cache` for caching abstractions
   - `boundary/search-advanced` for Elasticsearch/Solr integration
4. **Performance Optimizations**: AOT compilation options for production
