API design principles, examples, and implementation patterns for the
Boundary Framework.

=== Overview

* link:index.adoc[*API Overview*] - API design principles, conventions,
and patterns

=== Examples

==== Complete Implementations

* link:post-users-example.adoc[*POST /users Example*] - Complete
endpoint implementation walkthrough showing:
** Schema definition (Malli)
** Core business logic (pure functions)
** Service orchestration (shell layer)
** HTTP handler implementation
** Request/response handling
** Error handling

=== API Design Principles

The Boundary Framework follows these API design principles:

[arabic]
. *RESTful conventions* - Standard HTTP methods and status codes
. *Consistent error format* - Structured error responses across all
endpoints
. *Schema-first validation* - Malli schemas define and validate all
requests
. *Pure core logic* - Business logic separated from HTTP concerns
. *Multi-interface support* - Same logic accessible via REST, CLI, and
Web UI
