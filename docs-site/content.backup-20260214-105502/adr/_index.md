# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This section contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Boundary Framework.

## What is an ADR?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The issue or decision point
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The implications of the decision

## ADR Index

Content will be migrated from the boundary-docs repository.
