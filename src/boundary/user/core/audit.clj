  "Pure functions for creating audit log entries.
   
   This namespace contains CORE (pure) functions for audit trail management.
   In FC/IS architecture, this is the CORE that:
   - Contains pure business logic for audit entry creation
   - No side effects - returns data structures only
   - All I/O is delegated to shell layer (persistence)
   
   Key FC/IS principles:
   - Pure functions only - deterministic, no side effects
   - Returns data that shell layer will persist
   - Business rules for what gets audited and how")
