(ns boundary.shared.core.validation.coverage
  "Pure coverage computation and reporting for validation rules.

  All functions are pure with no side effects. Data is injected via function parameters.
  File I/O belongs in test helpers or Kaocha plugins.

  Example usage:

    ;; Compute coverage
    (def result (compute {:registered #{:user.email/required :user.name/required}
                         :executed #{:user.email/required}

    ;; => {:total 2 :executed 1 :pct 50.0 :per-module {...} :missing #{:user.name/required}}

    ;; Generate human-readable report
    (human-report result)
    ;; => \"Coverage: 50.0% (1/2)\n  Module: user - 50.0% (1/2)\n  Missing: :user.name/required\"
