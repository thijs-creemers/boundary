(ns boundary.platform.shell.interfaces.cli.middleware
  "CLI middleware for command execution with enhanced error context (imperative shell).
   
   This namespace provides reusable CLI middleware that can be used across
   different modules and applications for consistent observability and
   error handling in command-line interfaces.
   
   Middleware functions handle CLI boundaries: command execution interception,
   context generation, logging, and exception handling with enhanced context
   preservation for debugging.

   Features:
   - Command correlation ID generation
   - Tenant and user context extraction from config/environment
   - Structured command execution logging with observability context
   - Command timing and error reporting with enhanced context
   - Error reporting breadcrumb integration"
