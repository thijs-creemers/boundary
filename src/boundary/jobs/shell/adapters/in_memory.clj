(ns boundary.jobs.shell.adapters.in-memory
  "In-memory job queue implementation for development and testing.

   Uses Clojure atoms and data structures for job queuing. This adapter is
   suitable for:
   - Local development without Redis
   - Fast unit testing
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Learning and tutorials

   NOT suitable for:
   - Production use (no persistence, single-process only)
   - Distributed systems (not shared across processes)
   - High-volume job processing (limited by memory)

   State is stored in atoms with the following structure:
   - jobs: Map of job-id -> job
   - queues: Map of queue-name -> priority-map of [priority job-ids]
   - scheduled: Sorted set of [execute-at job-id] pairs
   - failed: Vector of failed job-ids
   - stats: Map of queue-name -> statistics"
