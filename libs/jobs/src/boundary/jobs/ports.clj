(ns boundary.jobs.ports
  "Port definitions for background job processing.

   This module defines protocols for asynchronous job processing, similar to
   Sidekiq (Ruby) or Celery (Python). Jobs can be queued, scheduled, and
   processed asynchronously with retry logic.

   Key Features:
   - Job enqueueing and scheduling
   - Priority queues
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queue for failed jobs
   - Job monitoring and statistics")
