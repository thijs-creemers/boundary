  "Database-backed job queue (IJobQueue) on next.jdbc.

   Lets an app run durable background jobs on its existing SQL database (H2 or
   PostgreSQL) without standing up Redis, and survive a Redis outage. Implements
   the same reliable-dequeue contract as the Redis adapter:

   - `dequeue-job!` atomically claims the next ready row (sets status=processing,
     locked_by/locked_at) so a worker that crashes mid-job does not lose it.
   - `ack-job!` removes the row once the worker is done with it.
   - `reclaim-abandoned-jobs!` returns rows whose lease has expired
     (locked_at older than `lease-ms`) back to `ready`, i.e. at-least-once.

   Portable SQL only (no `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`): the claim is a
   SELECT of the best candidate followed by a conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE
   status='ready'`. Concurrent workers that pick the same row have their UPDATEs
   serialized by the row lock — exactly one wins (update count 1); the losers
   retry the next candidate. This runs identically on H2 and PostgreSQL, so the
   reliability tests run on the default in-memory H2 test database.

   The authoritative job value is the JSON `payload` column (same wire format as
   the Redis adapter — keyword fields restored, instants as epoch-millis). The
   indexed columns (queue, priority_rank, status, execute_at, locked_at) exist
   only for ordering, claiming, and reclaim.

   Caveats:
   - The lease is fixed, not renewed (no heartbeat): a job still running after
     `lease-ms` is reclaimed and may run again concurrently. Set `:lease-ms`
     comfortably above your longest job, and/or keep handlers idempotent.
     (Lease renewal is a possible future addition.)
   - `payload` is `VARCHAR(1000000)`; keep serialized jobs under ~1 MB."
