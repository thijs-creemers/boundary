  "A complete non-JDBC implementation of the three user repository ports.

   BOU-366 narrowed those ports so that implementing them is an afternoon rather
   than a fortnight. This is what that claim costs, in full, and the test below
   drives the real UserService through it — so a method added to a port that the
   service starts calling fails here instead of at someone else's runtime."
