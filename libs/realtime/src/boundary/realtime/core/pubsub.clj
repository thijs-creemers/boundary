(ns boundary.realtime.core.pubsub
  "Pure functions for pub/sub topic management.
  
   Implements topic-based message routing where connections can subscribe to
   topics and receive messages published to those topics. All functions are pure
   (no I/O, no side effects) following FC/IS pattern.
   
   Key Features:
   - Subscribe connection to topic (add to subscription set)
   - Unsubscribe connection from topic (remove from set)
   - Find all subscribers for topic (set intersection)
   - Clean up subscriptions on disconnect (remove all for connection)
   
   Data Structure:
   Subscriptions are represented as a map:
   {topic-name #{connection-id-1 connection-id-2 ...}}")
