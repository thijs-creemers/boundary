(ns boundary.realtime.shell.pubsub-manager
  "In-memory pub/sub topic management (imperative shell).
  
   Implements IPubSubManager protocol using atom-based subscription storage.
   Coordinates between pure pub/sub core functions and stateful subscription
   management.
   
   Single-server implementation - subscriptions stored in memory. For
   multi-server deployments, would need Redis-backed implementation (v0.2.0).
   
   Thread-safe via atom swap operations."

(defn create-pubsub-manager
  "Create new in-memory pub/sub manager.
  
   Uses atom for thread-safe subscription storage. All state changes go
   through pure core functions via atom swap.
   
   Returns:
     AtomPubSubManager record implementing IPubSubManager
   
   Example:
     (def pubsub-mgr (create-pubsub-manager))
     (ports/subscribe-to-topic pubsub-mgr conn-id \"order:123\")"
  []
  (->AtomPubSubManager (atom {})))

  "Create pub/sub manager with initial state.
  
   Useful for testing or restoring from snapshot.
   
   Args:
     initial-subscriptions - Map of topic to set of connection IDs
   
   Returns:
     AtomPubSubManager with initial state
   
   Example:
