(ns boundary.realtime.ports
  "Port definitions for real-time WebSocket communication.
  
   This module defines protocols for WebSocket-based messaging, similar to
   Phoenix Channels (Elixir) or Socket.io (Node.js). Supports point-to-point,
   broadcast, and role-based messaging with JWT authentication.
   
   Key Features:
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Message routing (user, role, broadcast, connection-specific)
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Connection registry (in-memory or Redis)")
