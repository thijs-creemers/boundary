(defn string-literals
  "Every string literal in `content`, with the code that precedes it.

   Line-based regex cannot answer the questions a literal raises. Whether it is
   a docstring depends on the form it sits in, which may start on an earlier
   line; whether it is a regex depends on a `#` that a per-line match discards;
   and a multi-line string is several lines that are one token. The i18n scan
   asked all three per line and got them wrong — its docstring test was
   `(not (str/includes? line \"\\\"\"))`, which no line holding a string literal
   can satisfy, so the gate never reported anything.

   Args:
     content - Clojure source string

   Returns:
     Seq of {:text str :line int :regex? bool :preceding-code str}, in order.
     `:text` excludes the surrounding quotes. `:preceding-code` is the code
