(ns boundary.platform.shell.adapters.database.utils.driver-loader
  "Dynamic JDBC driver loading based on active database configurations.

   This namespace provides configuration-driven driver loading that eliminates
   the need to coordinate between configuration files and command-line aliases.
   Drivers are loaded dynamically based on which databases are marked as :active
   in the configuration files.

   Key Features:
   - Single source of truth: configuration files control everything
   - Clear error messages when drivers are missing
   - Automatic driver detection from active databases
   - No command-line alias coordination required

   Usage:
     (require '[boundary.platform.shell.adapters.database.utils.driver-loader :as dl])

     ;; Load drivers for active databases in current environment
     (dl/load-required-drivers!)

     ;; Load drivers for specific environment
     (dl/load-drivers-for-environment! \"dev\")"
  (:require [boundary.platform.shell.adapters.database.config :as db-config]
            [clojure.string :as str]
            [clojure.tools.logging :as log]))
