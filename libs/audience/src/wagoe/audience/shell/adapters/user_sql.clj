  "IUserDataSource over the application's users table.

   The audience service needs one to run at all — its init-key throws without a
   `:user-data-source` — and the protocol had no implementation anywhere, so the
   module could not boot and no application ever activated it (BOU-419).

   Queried by table name rather than through the user module: audience depends
   on no other Wagoe library, and reaching into `wagoe.user.shell.*` would be
   the cross-module coupling `bb check:ports` exists to prevent. `:table` is
   configurable for an application whose users live elsewhere."

  "Rename mapped columns and put timestamps in the form this driver compares.

   The core compiles a cutoff as an `Instant`: it is pure, so how that reaches
   the database is this layer's business.

   Text alone is not enough on SQLite. `Instant/toString` omits the fraction
   when it is zero, so a cutoff renders `…T00:00:00Z` while a value one
   millisecond later renders `…T00:00:00.001Z` — and `.` sorts before `Z`,
   putting the later instant first. Both sides of a comparison go through
   SQLite's `datetime()`, which is fixed width; comparison is then to the
   second, which is inside what a filter defined in whole days promises.

   An Instant outside a comparison — nested in a clause shape this does not
   recognise — still becomes the dialect's storage value rather than being left
   raw for the driver to guess at."
